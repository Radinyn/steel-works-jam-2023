POSITION: First Level Manager
GOAL: Collect 2 ultracans

#1 note
It's year 2051. Right after graduating, you got an internship offer in a market leading company.
Soon after joining, you realised that your boss is quite eccentric wealthy man...

#2 note
Company is associated with bioengineering, so you kinda expected this boring job in some kind of old laboratory.
However, instead of that, you got the office job with sweet Mrs Jola and lots of stressing tasks from your boss...

#3 boss
"You! Get me 2 ultracans of some juice! Quickly!" - Boss

#4 me
"He didn't even know your name... And why exactly does he need this stuff...?"

#5 boss
"Quickly! How long am I supposed to wait?" - Boss

#6 me
"Is the job as future manager really worth it...? I mean, one advantage is that I won't have any competition, because, well, nobody wants as 
    stressing job as this one..."
"I'll better go"
