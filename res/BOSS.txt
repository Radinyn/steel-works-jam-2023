"Hello dear. I've been waiting for you."

#2 me
Where is the boss??

#3 jola
"He is not here and he will not be. It was me ordering you all this time."

#4 me
What is this all stuff for? What is going on? 

#5 jola
"This stuff will lead to great thing... my creation!"
"The boss was just a coverup, and the experiment on employees succeeded!"
"Thanks to that and all of your hard work I will soon destroy the world by making all humans the brainless monsters, killing each other!"
"But excuse me for now, because I have to put one last element to my machine. Give me the app-le, it will power it!

#6 me
Oh no! I can't give her the app-le. I have to defeat her to save the world!
